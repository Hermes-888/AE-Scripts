Usage:
Start by creating a text file from a Storyboard. Each line of text will become a caption cue.

When the After Effects project is ready, run the CaptionCreator script.
It will open a dockable panel.
select the Import Captions button to open the text file.
The script will generate keyframes on a new text layer of the composition named Template.
The builder can see what they are building in the preview panel. 

Adjust the keyframes to sync the captions with the audio. 
Select the Find Keyframes button to sync the data to the keyframes.

When the captions are ready, click the Save VTT button in the script panel to generate a vtt file for captions. 
Hide the Captions Layer so it isn't visible on the exported video and export the video. 

The vtt file and final video should be kept in the same folder.


ToDo:
Use comp[0] if no Template is found? 
Let the user select which comp to use with a dropdown?
Test this in Premiere?
